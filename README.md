# Warhammer Battle Mapper

# A very simple battle map maker

This app is was made to help with creating scenarios for warhammer fantasy battle. This is somewhat of an experiment and may end up only receiving updates slowly.

### First

Install deps from project root `yarn` or `npm i`

### Start development server with:

`yarn start:dev` or `npm run start:dev`

It's possible to use a different port by specifying this first like so: 

`CVA_PORT=7788 yarn start:dev` to start with port 7788. Same for npm just include `CVA_PORT=7788` at the beginning.

### Build for production

`yarn build` or `npm run build`
